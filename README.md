# Hall_sensor_Arduino_Matlab


This code is designed for use with Arduino, Matlab, and a Hall Effect Sensor with an accompanying magnet. 

Its purpose it to help visualize the range of the sensor in the digits. This is useful when assembling the digits and determining the polarity of the magnetics.

To run, plug your computer into the Arduino with the sensor hooked up with power, ground, and analog signal. 
Make sure you check the data sheet of the sensor to ensure its wired correctly. Upload the provided sketch,
in Arduino then run the Matlab code. To stop the code, press the red button on the Arduino 
(ran initially on an Arduino Mega 2560).
